## What is Knotpad?

Knotpad is a local-first project management tool for developers and AI agents. Write a note — every checkbox becomes a real, tracked task visible as a board, list, calendar, graph, or dashboard. No forms, no retyping, no context switching.

---

## MCP Server — Built-in & Cloud-hosted

Knotpad exposes a full **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server. Connect any MCP-compatible tool so your agent can become a project partner:

- Auto-discovers workspaces (`TEAM` vs `PERSONAL`) and team member handles
- Pulls project goals, specs, and vision notes to instantly align the agent before it touches anything
- Searches and reads note contents across the entire workspace
- Automatically constructs folders and moves notes to organize projects dynamically
- Appends progress updates or fully rewrites prose — honoring user-defined note permissions
- Claim tasks to lock them and avoid team or multi-agent conflicts
- Transition tasks across `open → in_progress → review → done`
- Return tasks to the open queue with detailed logs if blocked
- Updates priorities, due dates, and assignees directly on the task line without altering adjacent prose
- Assign tasks to team memebers. 
- Reads related refrenced notes or task
- Parses file paths , priorities and date ranges straight from text

## Security & Privacy

Since Knotpad runs as a desktop application with optional cloud sync, here is how your data and credentials are handled:
- **Local-First**: By default, all your note-taking, task tracking, and workspace data are saved directly on your device.
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Sensitive session keys and authentication credentials are saved securely in your operating system's native credential store, never in insecure browser storage.
- **Optional Cloud Sync**: Cloud synchronization is fully opt-in. If enabled, your data is transferred using secure encryption protocols and stored encrypted-at-rest.
- **Disclaimer**: Knotpad is provided "as is" and "as available", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
